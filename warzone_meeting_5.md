Preliminaries:

- Tool to help you write shell scripts: [ShellCheck - finds bugs in your shell scripts](https://www.shellcheck.net/)

Luke saw me wondering why running a notebook from [here](https://github.com/fomightez/pdbsum-binder) wasn't working.[history of a particular script](https://github.com/fomightez/structurework/commits/master/pdbsum-utilities/similarities_in_proteinprotein_interactions.py). Look at the Commit on April 9th there by clicking the button with `61b5d08` on the right of it in the History listing.
