# Warzone Pythonistas: Fifth meeting


#### For working tonight:

launch your own session at:  
https://github.com/firasm/RTC_test


Preliminaries:

- Tool to help you write shell scripts: [ShellCheck - finds bugs in your shell scripts](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
- Whoops! Good example of why Github is nice. Luke saw me wondering why running a notebook from [here](https://github.com/fomightez/pdbsum-binder) wasn't working.[history of a particular script](https://github.com/fomightez/structurework/commits/master/pdbsum-utilities/similarities_in_proteinprotein_interactions.py). Look at the Commit on April 9th there by clicking the button with `61b5d08` on the right of it in the History listing.
- Further musings on 'Getting code from GitHub that you can work with' from last session discussion. 
  - I suggest that Binder is best for now because can edit code and run and even update the environment if you need to do that in order to run. (fetch via `curl` or `wget` or clone with `git clone`)
  - If you just want to edit the code from Github check out adding `1s` in front of `.com` in URL. Example: [Plain Github example page](https://github.com/fomightez/pdbsum-binder) at `https://github.com/fomightez/pdbsum-binder` vs [Github Example in VSCode in your browser](https://github1s.com/fomightez/pdbsum-binder) at `https://github1s.com/fomightez/pdbsum-binder`.
