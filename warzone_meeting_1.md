## Meeting

Learning Python these days it helps to place it more of data science context because ecosystem much more robust now than the past where you wrote `python <script_name>` and that was the bulk of running python. 



Place to run some stuff in the cloud can be accessed from several links available at https://github.com/binder-examples 
Tour of the basics there of the simplest example:
https://github.com/binder-examples/requirements  
Go there and press `launch binder` to launch a session
- notebook
- terminal
- Jupyter dashboard

Quickly showed JupyterLab interface. (Directly can be seen at https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab)

In terminal you can get to a python console by typing `python`

In terminal you can get to a python console by typing `ipython`

Up and down arrows work to scroll back among previous command in terminal and both types of consoles.

We showed type-casting a bit by casting a float to an integer.

```python
cat = 2
dog = 4.0
type(cat*dog)
s = int(cat*dog)
type(s)
```

To check type, use `type()` with the object to query in the parantheses.
